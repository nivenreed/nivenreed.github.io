            <h2>About Me.</h2>
             <p>I am a trainee Web Developer, based in South East London. 
                This site is a place for me to demonstrate my journey as I learn to code.<br>
                I will display the projects that I work on and demonstrate the skills I have learnt.</p>
            <br>

            <p>After spending the last 17 years working in sales, I now feel it is time for a new challenge.<br>

                I think my sales career has given me the skills to be able to communicate well with not only a team but also the client. </p>

        <div class="my-background">
            <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
            <p> When not learning to code I enjoy the outdoors and my hobbies include photography, bee keeping and bbqing on my ceramic Kamado grill.

        <div class="beekeeping">
            <h2>Bee Keeping.</h2>
            <p>I have had an interest in bees from a very young age. About 8 years ago I decided to learn more.
                After attending a beginner beekeeping course I got my firts colony and have been keeping bees ever since.

        <div class="bbq">
            <h2>Bbq.</h2>
            <p>During lock down I decided to invest in a bbq I had been after for many years!
                The Kamado is a ceramic bbq that you can cook anything you would normally cook in the oven but outside over coal. 
                This quickly turned into a new hobby or should I say passion. There really is nothing better than cooking outside.

        <div class="photography">
            <h2>Photography.</h2>
            <p>Photography is another hobby I have had for many years. 
                My very very first Job when leaving college was working in a photographic shop.
                I learn't so much from how to operate any camera to printing and developing films. 
                There were no digital cameras back when I started! 
                Whenever I can I love to take one of my many cameras out and get creative. 
                Even sometimes dig out one of the old film cameras.
